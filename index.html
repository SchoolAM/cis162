	<h2> About me </h2>
	
		
	<p>
	Hello, My name is Davinci Pablo and Im in class 162 for HTML/CSS and also class 160 for web development. The cool part about this is that I have the same professor for both classes. In college for About 
	Three almost four years and only two of those years where Online during Covid-19. It's pretty sad to say the lest since I kinda wanna go back to an actual class, but Remote classes are ok for now. Hopefully eveything gose well this 
	year, and that we can go back to the campus without a face mask. 	
    </p>
